### Website

It's a portfolio! I know, I didn't label it a "portfolio" because I thought it was boring and "dossier"[^dossier] sounded cool.

### Gwyn

I'm an [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) who lives and breathes data. Not kidding: one of my primary projects is to digitise all the physical things in my life and [store them](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com) appropriately, which includes really crazy things like decades-old parking tickets and my immunisation booklet from when I was a baby.

My career began in academic libraries, stumbled into computer science when I completed my [library diploma](/education/tafe) and continued on to [university](/education/university), involved lots of databases until I discovered the role of a Data Engineer ([the plumbing of Data Science](https://medium.com/plumbersofdatascience)) and realised that I had found my perfect role.

Today[^today], I am building this website in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), sorting through boxes of things to be digitised, updating my home [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster in [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), and waiting for the weekly Community Games Night on [Discord](https://discord.com).

Tomorrow is the fortnightly occurrance of our house's "low tech" day, where we pack away our laptops, smart phones, and wearables.

Next week, my husband and I will be staying in a townhouse [on the waterfront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle) for a few days, bringing our [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Wiki_MiSTer/wiki) device for a decent break from home and chores.
