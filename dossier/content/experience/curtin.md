**Curtin University of Technology** - 
*Tenure: 6 Months*

Having completed two Structured Workplace Learning placements at this university during high school, I reached out to the person who took responsibility of those placements to ask if she'd serve as a referee on my first job hunt.

Instead, she offered me a three-month contract at the Teaching Resources Library two days per week, which was later extended until the end of the first semester and included Saturdays at the main library on campus: T.L. Robertson Library.

### Responsibilities

- Reshelving items
- Reviewing item catalogues for teaching areas

#### T.L. Robertson Library
- Processing loans and returns

The creation of [Curtin University](https://www.curtin.edu.au) was announced in June of 1962, though it was originally established as the Western Australian Institute of Technology in response to the Perth Technical College outgrowing its campus in Perth's CBD. Building is completed in 1966, with the main library - T.L. Robertson Library - opening in 1971.

An amendment passed in December of 1986 to grant it university status, and it began operating as Curtin University of Technology in 1987.

As of March in 2023, Curtin University consists of over:
- 50,000 students
- 3,000 staff

- Kalgoorlie, Western Australia (School of Mines: Minerals, Energy and Chemical Engineering)
